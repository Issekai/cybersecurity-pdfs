some of these tutorials will have certain commands cut short. this is 
because the commands are really long to the point where you have to side 
scroll to see the rest. saving a file as a pdf only saves the text that is 
visible on my screen. if you ever get confused, copy the title of the 
tutorial and search it up online so you can see the rest of the command.
